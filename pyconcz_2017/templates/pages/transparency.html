      <p>
        The organization team believes that all events should be
        accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their
        background. We agree that a clear and specific Code of Conduct
        is a necessity for any event.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a href="/2016/about/code.1.html">
          Code of Conduct</a> was based on Conference anti-harassment
          policy from Geek feminism wiki and edited to be as
          specific to our event as possible
        </li>

        <li>
          Agreeing to the Code was mandatory when buying a ticket
        </li>

        <li>
          Two contact persons (male and female) were assigned and
          their phone numbers were visibly posted around the venue
        </li>

        <li>
          Attendees were reminded of the Code in the opening speech of
          each day
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What could have been done:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Summary of the Code in both languages were not posted around
          the venue
        </li>

        <li>
          There was no easy way to report an incident other than to
          call a CoC contact person
        </li>

        <li>
          Czech language version of the Code was not accessible
          on the website

        Anonymized incidents:

        <li>
          During one of the keynotes, inappropriate image was used in
          a slideshow. The speaker was reminded, that a Code of
          Conduct applies to keynotes as well. No further action was
          taken.
        </li>

        <li>
          During one of the lightning talks, speaker used
          disrespectful language towards different initiatives that
          aim to include underrepresented groups into IT. In his
          presentation he also used a slide that could be offensive to
          some groups. One of the attendees reacted to this by angrily
          leaving the venue. The speaker posted an apology in public
          group chat and also admitted his mistake in private
          discussion with one of the CoC contacts. The attendee
          apologized for his behaviour in email to one of the CoC
          contacts and in private discussion with head conference
          organizer. No video or slides will be published from this
          lightning talk.
