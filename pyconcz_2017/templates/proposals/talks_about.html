  <p>
    PyCon CZ attracts professional developers, test engineers and localization
    and documentation specialists from all walks of life, including industry,
    government, and science, as well as enthusiast and students. We’re looking
    for proposals for presentations and workshops on any aspect of Python
    programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced. For your
    inspiration, our local Python Community has suggested they’d love to see
    talks on the following topics, for example:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Testing, AsyncIO, REST, Interoperability, Python Vs JS, IoT, Android.PY,
      Community
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or
    commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation
    is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for
    inclusion in the program. We're especially interested in short presentations
    that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show
    attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an
    application? Do you have inspiring lesson’s learned to share?
  </p>

  <h2>First Time Speakers</h2>

  <p>
    We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference and we are
    eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who
    have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it!
    Please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be
    interested.
  </p>

  <h2>Speaker Benefits</h2>

  <p>
    All speakers will receive ONE free conference ticket automatically. As a
    speaker, if you or your organisation can afford to register and purchase a
    ticket anyway at full price, please do! All such payments will go directly
    towards our financial assistance pool to help people who could not otherwise
    afford to attend the conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will not be automatically registered as an attendee for the conference;
    you will need to register yourself and failure to do so may result in loss
    of your talk slot(s)!
  </p>

  <h2>Financial Assistance</h2>

  <p>
    PyCon CZ offers a generous financial assistance programme, so that some
    attendees and speakers have some -- or in rare cases, all -- of their
    expenses such as flight, hotel and admission provided to them from the
    conference budget.
  </p>

  <p>
    PyCon CZ strongly encourages those people in need to apply for
    financial assistance -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses,
    we will try our best to at least give you discounted admission! The
    application process is simple, and straightforward. It’s also very
    liberal. Apply for a grant on the <a href="/2017/proposals/financial-aid">
    Financial Assistance page</a>.
  </p>

    Every session at PyCon CZ will have professionally-produced video recordings
